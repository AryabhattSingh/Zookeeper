# Zookeeper

This Java project serves as a practical introduction to Java programming, covering various fundamental concepts. The project's primary focus is on providing a hands-on understanding of -
- Different primitive data types
- Taking user input
- Working with variables of primitive as well as non-primitive data types like arrays and strings
- Managing loops
- Utilizing string functions
- Using arrays for strings
- Implementing exception handling
- Defining and utilizing user-defined exceptions.

## Introduction

The "Zookeeper" project is a console-based Java application designed to introduce beginners to fundamental Java concepts. Through a structured menu-driven interface, users will explore topics such as data types, user input handling, variable manipulation, string processing, loops, arrays, and exception management. The project provides a hands-on approach to learning these concepts in a practical context.

The user interacts with a virtual zookeeper.

## Functionality

### `Welcome Message`
Upon launching the program, the user is greeted with a warm welcome message from the zookeeper.

### `Menu Options`
After the welcome message, the user is presented with two options:
1. View a habitat
2. Exit

### `Viewing a Habitat`
If the user selects `View a habitat`, they will be further prompted with a menu offering two choices:
1. Enter the habitat number
2. Exit

If the user chooses to `Enter habitat number`, they will be asked to input the habitat number. The habitat number ranges from 1 to 6. The program ensures that the user input is valid in any case by implementing infinite loops and handling exceptions.

If the entered habitat number is valid, the program displays an ASCII art representation of the corresponding animal.

### `Exiting the Program`

If the user chooses `Exit` from the main menu or the second menu, the program terminates, bidding the user farewell.

### `Exception Handling`
The Zookeeper project includes comprehensive exception-handling mechanisms to account for unexpected inputs and ensure the program runs smoothly. These mechanisms prevent crashes and provide users with helpful error messages when they input unexpected values.
